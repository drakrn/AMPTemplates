Some of my AMP templates

## Making generic module templates

See the wiki article for the module: <https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMP/wiki/Configuring-the-'Generic'-AMP-module>

You can also use the online configurator at <https://config.getamp.sh/> to help with building templates.

There is a much more robust version of the [online configuration](https://iceofwraith.github.io/GenericConfigGen/) tool that is still in beta. This should provide much better results than the above even so. If you have any feedback, please contact IceOfWraith in the CubeCoders Discord.

**The online configurator can be used as a starting point for making templates. However, it will not generally produce a fully functioning template. Templates produced using the generator can be deployed for personal use but will not be accepted into the CubeCoders repository.**

## Sharing templates

I do not plan to accept people's templates. Your time will better be valued with [the official AMP templates repository](https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMPTemplates/tree/main).
